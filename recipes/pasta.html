        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) package uncooked pasta shells</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>Â½ tablespoon finely minced onion</li>
                <li>1 orange bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
                <li>1 pound bulk Italian sausage</li>
                <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 13 minutes; drain.</li>

Stir in Italian sausage; cook and stir until browned and cooked through, about 8 minutes. Stir in undrained tomatoes and heavy cream; reduce heat to medium-low and cook 5 minutes more.</li>
                <li>Mix pasta into sauce; stir in the Parmesan cheese and garnish with fresh parsley.</li>
            </ol>
